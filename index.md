Whatever Apple hardware work you need, Teletek should be your first choice!  We provide
expert, authorized service for iMacs, iPhones, iPods, and iPads.

Teletek has been an Apple Authorized Service Provider since 1992, and has performed
repairs, upgrades, and general maintenance on over 1000 devices.  So whatever
ails your Mac, we have seen it before and know what to do to bring it back!

For all repairs, Teletek offers same-day diagnostics.  Our typical turnaround time is
less than two business days.

All work is done on site, and your hardware will never be shipped out for repair!

Teletek is a locally-owned small business, and all work is personally performed
by the owner.

Teletek provides walk-in service Mon-Fri 10-2 and 4-6, and offers Saturday appointments.
Feel free to call us for an initial consult any time during business hours!

Teletek also offers group and individual training for all Apple hardware.
